### Background

Currently working as a UI/UX consultant in Hong Kong. 
I have been working in the field of UI/UX and product design for the past 6 years. 
I will be focusing this article on progressing the design career and as well as job application process.

I first read about OKR for self-learning, is from Sophia Li's github page. I already
knew about OKRs back then but it never occurred to me to use it personally. It was a
hard time for me as I was on furlough in my previous company after the initial wave of
COVID-19. There was not even a timeline on when I could get back to work. Reading
Sophia's progress and her OKR planning was a revelation. I started to use it for
planning my career, tracking my progress for job hunting.


### Plan, Focus, Reflect: A loop to make progress

Just like this, work on delivering your key results every day and take an uninterrupted
hour at the end of each month to reflect, plan and mark your progress in Notion. Finding
a friend hosting the review session with yourself is also useful too. For me, the target
was a bit ambitious and I did not complete all the objectives and tasks that I have set
at the beginning of the quarter. Frankly, only few tasks have met the target. But I am
very satisfied with this framework, which allows me to set a clear direction and to
review it regularly.

This quote shares the same way I feel when I practice Design OKR. As long as I'm
incrementally better than myself yesterday, no matter how small the changes I make, it
could have compound effect toward a success. Now that a big objective of my Design OKR
has completed, I'm still searching for my next one, could be building my own product,
earning side income, or for real to speak at design events. Before that happens, let me
know what you think about this approach on Twitter and I would love to answer any of
your questions!
