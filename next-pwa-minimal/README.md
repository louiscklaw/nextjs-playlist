[TOC]

This example demonstrates how to use `next-pwa` plugin to turn a `next.js` based web application into a progressive web application easily.

It uses `fastify` as a custom server in order to serve `sw.js` and `precache` script statically, and it contains minimal icon set and a `manifest.json` in static folder. The example also features full offline support and full (all 100) scores on lighthouse report.
